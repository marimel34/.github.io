            <h2>Intro: The Heart of the Ode</h2>
            <p>When you think of her story, you think of our history. When you think of her story, you think of a journey that has given more than it has taken. A journey in which she has had to struggle and fight, yet still the love she continues to give and exude is not tainted, but strengthened.</p>
            <p>This is a prose ode, the telling of love of love, love by her, love for her. A prose ode for Melissa. And this, her day, on another completion of her journey around the sun.</p>
            <p>She is love. The love she gives. The love she exudes. The love she evokes. It is never a tiresome action to express the love that we have for her. If you know Melissa, you know that she is effervescent. If you know her, then you know the existence that she leads. You know the strength that she carries. You also know that she is fearless. And yet she walks with grace. She imagines, she envisions. Yet she shares.</p>
            <p>And when I think of her today, I think of all that she has been to us. I think of everything that she is. She has been the center of our stories. Not only for this season, but for the many past seasons that we have shared this journey together.</p>
            <p>Melissaâ€™s story is one of struggle and of triumph. And she will tell you without shame that there have been many burdensome days. Parts of her story that bruised deep and hit hard. Moments when she was in the shadows of battle. But she has triumphed. She has succeeded.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-struggle">
            <h2>Her Struggle and Triumph</h2>
            <p>The first thing to be her is to be one who has fought. No . . . it is easy to think, seeing her glow now, that she has had a journey filled with sugar and spice and daffodils on a fall day. But that was not so. Winter came for her. After her. She has had cold and hard and long days. She has had seasons of breaking. Seasons of collapsed hopes and dreams. Seasons when dark intents set their sights upon her.</p>
            <p>But through perseverance, through hard work, she was successful. She overcame. And her overcoming has been no small thing. Because without a doubt, on this day; Ubuntu: I am because we are. I am. William is. We are. Because she overcame.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="pic1.jpg" alt="A photo celebrating her struggle and triumph" style="max-height: 400px;">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-opened">
            <h2>The One Who Has Opened</h2>
            <p>The second thing to be her is to be one who has opened. Now this is no small matter, when she had every reason to remain closed. When dark forces and evil entities lurked about, trying to get into her soul. When those who had been given welcome sought to harm. When she should have remained closed, she decided to reopen. She opened her heart, her soul, her love to me, to us.</p>
            <p>And that is strength that defines, in no uncertain terms, the nature of the woman who she is. When a house that has been robbed, stolen from, and should have closed out others to remain in the cold still decides to be open, to be welcoming, to remain hopeful, that is harder than to be closed.</p>
            <p>Through her continued openness, she has enabled the creation of beauty, the creation of love, the creation of possibilities. Not only did this new creation mean that she believed in her future, but she chose to share that future, to make it our future. And our collective future exists because she remained open and allowed this love to remain.</p>
            <p>That she has opted to share her heart with me is a celebration warranting its own echoes; echoes of praise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-family">
            <h2>The One Who Loves Family</h2>
            <p>The third thing to be her is to be one who loves family, who has a big enough heart that generations of many, many others; family, relatives, close and distant, can have a place in it. She loves hard, she loves deep, she loves wide. She loves family, even those who are less than deserving. She loves. She decides to love.</p>
            <p>The thing about this type of love is that it takes strength and effort to remain, to show up, to be. And quite often, in the case of many recipients of this love, it is a love that sometimes faces resistance. But still, she chooses to love. This is everything. She chooses to love her family. She chooses to love deep and wide, even in the face of resistance, even in the absence of reciprocation from many.</p>
            <p>If you know her, you know love. Granted, she will perhaps deny this, but the love that exists with her, the love that she gives, is the very air she breathes. It is too much, too obvious, too big to deny. And so, to know her is to know the love that she is, the big, wide, deep love that she gives, that remains.</p>
            <p>The love for family. The love for community. The love for her village. The love for building more, for creating new villages. It is a deep, big, wide love of possibilities.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="pic2.jpg" alt="A photo celebrating her love for family" style="max-height: 400px;">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-committed">
            <h2>The One Who Is Committed</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="pic3.jpg" alt="A photo celebrating her commitment" style="max-height: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>The fourth thing to be her is to be one who is committed. And this commitment is multifaceted, ever-flowing. This commitment is an unwavering fealty to her people, those of us who are blessed beyond measure to be a part of her.</p>
            <p>This commitment also shows itself in steadfast duty, in hard work, in the insistence on not just participating in a job, but daily waking up to make a change, to live in a career, a divine calling, a vocation. Oh, to be her. This is a gift that keeps on giving to the world, even on days when it is hard, when it is weary. On days when it seems like too much, she remains committed.</p>
            <p>To know her is to know that she doesnâ€™t just go to work, she goes ministering. Every touch of care, every touch of healing, every hurting body, every wounded one that comes into her care feels this commitment, this grace, this gentle wind of divine refreshment, this hope.</p>
            <p>She is committed to her village. She is committed to us. She is committed to healing. She is committed to her calling. And even on rough days, even on weary days, even when she has every reason not to be, she stays committed. She gets up, and she goes out. To live in that commitment, to make lives better, that cannot go unnoticed.</p>
            <p>Oh, to be her. What a gift that keeps on giving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-kindness">
            <h2>To Live Into Kindness</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="pic4.jpg" alt="A photo celebrating her kindness" style="max-height: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>The fifth thing to be her is to live into kindness. Now, I know that kindness has become an overused attribution, short of being a clichÃ©. But for her, it is not just an attribute. It is not simply the willingness to give everything. . . nay, even her last, for the well-being of the stranger and of others. It is life. It is a principle by which she lives. It is something she walks in. I call it radical kindness.</p>
            <p>See, it is not a kindness that excuses irresponsibility, but a kindness that challenges. It is a kindness that lets you know. It is a kindness that rescues. It is a kindness that is present. She is kind. She is kind to the straggler by the wayside, the homeless. She is kind even to those who have never, and will never be able to return her kindness. And she lives into this kindness with joy.</p>
            <p>She has taught me kindness, genuine kindness, kindness even when it is inconvenient, when it is not popular, kindness behind the scenes. Her type of kindness will never seek out a camera or paparazzi. It will never press record. It is a kindness that is silent, that is subtle, that is not loud. It does not seek affirmation, but it is ever-present, ever-abiding, enduring.</p>
            <p>Her kindness has been warmth on a cold day. It has been the assurance that everything will be okay. Her kindness has been the motif, the extra strength, the extra juice that we have needed to proceed in seasons of turmoil.</p>
            <p>Her kindness extends not just to those who are recipients of her ever-abiding love, but it knows no bounds. It knows no familiarity. She is kind.</p>
            <p>Oh, to be her. To be kind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-mother">
            <h2>To Be A Mother</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="pic5.jpg" alt="A photo celebrating her motherhood" style="max-height: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>Then another thing to be her is to be mother. To be the goddess of childcare. See, for her, motherhood is stewardship. It is to be enlisted in the divine call to nurture the future, to nurture Godâ€™s future.</p>
            <p>She does many things, and she is the best at many things. But indeed, she is the best at motherhood. She not only wears motherhood; she never takes a break from it. She is intentional about every step. She knows the plan. She lives into it. She has a strategy. She sees the outcome, and she ensures that the little flock God has given her is raised according to the nurture and admonition of God, that the little flock is in the right way.</p>
            <p>The little one is cared for morning, evening, and at all times. The way she lives out motherhood is not just inspiring, it is a divine skill, an art that cannot be replicated. She is firm but loving. She is strong but tender. She is a discerning mother, attentive to every sigh, every playful laughter, even every shrug from the little flock. She is attentive, she listens, she guides even the small apprehensions. She carries the flock in her bosom of love.</p>
            <p>She does motherhood in the way of God. She is a mother par excellence. And the gifting of further flock will only mean better, stronger, more divine motherhood.</p>
            <p>Oh, to be her, to be a mother.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-wife">
            <h2>To Be A Wife</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="pic6.jpg" alt="A photo celebrating her as a wife" style="max-height: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>And then, to be her, and this is my favorite, for obvious reasons; to be her is to be a wife, to be my wife, to be the one I have the privilege of journeying with, the privilege of walking through the changing seasons with, the privilege of co-laboring in love. Oh, to be her. Oh, to be my wife. Oh, to be my love.</p>
            <p>In early hindsight, it is perhaps more sustainable that a separate ode of love be composed in her name, that is yet and shall be.</p>
            <p>But for now, she is my wife. A wife who has resolved to be the bearer of the feminine, to be the bearer of the feminine love that I receive, to be the morning smile, the early voice, the first reason for praise each day.</p>
            <p>See, in her calling as wife, she is everything. She makes the giving of love, look effortless. Each gesture, each smile, each moment shared, each intentional bit is love that she gives, love that only the sole receiver can fully know. She carries an immense capacity to love, to be loved. She opens new possibilities and introduces new avenues of love. Each day, she discovers and shares the discovery of how love can extend even more. This, in itself, is a gift of the rarest order.</p>
            <p>But in her role as wife, as lover, she cares, she shows up, she protects, she fills, she gives. What she gives, she supports. She is present. See, to exist in love with one who is a perpetual dreamer, a consistent climber and yearner for more, is no easy feat. But her response of radical yet practical, intense support defines love. Oh, to be her. Oh, to be my wife.</p>
            <p>See, in this ode to Melissa, she is that and more. Oh, to be her, to be a wife, to be a mother, to be kind, to live in kindness, to be one who is committed, to be one with extensive love for the village, for her family, to be one who has opened her heart and remained in the light of love and purity, to be one who has fought and triumphed, is to be her. To be Melissa</p>
            <p>This is her. And on this, her journey around the sun, celebrations are inadequate to honor and capture her in her fullness. So, when you see her smiling, when you see her living in her glow, when you see her living in Godâ€™s divine perfect will for her, when you see her reaping the rewards of everything she is, when you see her wearing her crown, do not envy her crown. Do not lament her crown. Because certainly it is everlastingly hard. . .nay, impossible, to wear and carry the cross that she has carried.</p>
            <p>When you see her existing in her fullness, sharing her joy, giving her laughter, offering everything she is to the world, celebrate her. Applaud her. Thank God for her. Because to be her is to be a gift so unique, a gift that God has given us for these times and seasons.</p>
            <p>Oh, to be her. An ode to Melissa.</p>
            <p>Happy birthday to her.</p>
